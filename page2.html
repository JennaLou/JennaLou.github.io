<p>This is my Vacation Spot project. We used a Google Map API to draw the map createmarker. I to choose different
    location around the world that we find interesting for vacation. This project is basically a map with just 
    red marker into a specific country and when you click the marker it will show which city, state or country it is
    and theres a picture at the bottom showing what the vacation spot looks like and how we find that vacation sppot so interesting.
    Creating this map project uses basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Also had to put the latitude and altitude of the specific country or state    that we chose for the vacation spot. I chose this project because I found it interesting because if people are searching for vacation spots they can just easily look at this map and click the market and they will see where is it and what it looks like. This project was really interesting and fun to create.</p>
