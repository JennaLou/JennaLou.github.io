        <p>This page is about the treatments for HIV/AIDS. I did this research and presentation for my English class when I was in Sophomore. 
    I made a thesis and explained my topic, and we had to find evidence about it. I chose Treatment for HIV/AIDS because
    I found it interesting to research about and I wanted to learn how to treat these type of viruses and diseases. Since
    I am intrested to be in medical field I wanted to research treatments and what type of medicines that doctor's uses to
    treat the any types of diseases such as AIDS. I found my research fun and interesting but stressing because it was time consuming and I had to read a lot of articles for this research and presentation. <br>
            
        <br>I spent 1 month for this project and I had to make a 10 pages of thesis essay about this project and that really stressed me out. But this research/presentation became really successful and I received a pretty good grade for my final. This project was the most hardest project I've ever done in my Sophomore Year because it was time consuming. I had to do different projects and homeworks from other classes while doing this Research Project. In addition to that my English teacher gave us 4 more different projects to do and that made me more stressed. But I'm proud of myself for not giving up, putting all my efforts and balancing the time management for this project. I lacked sleep from researching and thinking what to put on my essay and to this presentation. But overall, this project was fun and really interesting to do if you are interested to be in medical field in the future.</p>
