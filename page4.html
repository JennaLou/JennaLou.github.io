    <p>This is my EGG DROP PROJECT for my Physics class, In this project we had to 
    think and draw a design for the Egg Drop. Basically, a design that will protect the egg when you drop it. 
    But by doing this project theres a rule, we cant use foam and other stuff that are squishy and bouncy  to protect the egg. 
    This project was really challenging because I had to do a lot of research and thinkinng about what design I should do. 
    But I came it with a toilet paper cone, fat food, straws and 5 cottons to build my project. I put all the straws together
    with a hot glue and make them all thick so when iitt drops it will protect the egg. And then I glued the cone on top of the straws.<br>
        
    <br>Then, I put 5 cotton balls inside to kind of support the egg when it reaches the impact. So when we put the egg inside the cone 
    I had to glue the plywood on top of the cone so when it drops the egg wouldn't bounce back. I would say this project oor experiment
    was pretty fun because making something by your own to protect something means a lot. And then when I dropped my thing now to check
    if the egg is gonna break. My egg didn't break, so that means the egg is safe and I made a pretty safe model to protect the egg
    and that gave me an A in my physics class. I feel really accomplished when I found out my egg didn't break.</p>
